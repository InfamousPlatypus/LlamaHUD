# LlamaHUD
## About
LlamaHUD is a minimal LLM frontend that operates under the assumption that there is one conversation, one model, one provider.

The GUI is very simple, a chat history, a text box and a submit buttion. This comes from our operating model that has two parts

### Everything can be done with text.
### Everything can be done in notifications.

Sadly we are currently blocked in the second part by the fact that notification programs do not support 

Minimal UI, fast, light, /commands can run your entire computer. We are starting out with json editing, allowing for updating settings.json.
